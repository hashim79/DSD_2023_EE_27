# Lab 3: Digital System Design - Sequential Logic

## Objective
The purpose of this lab is to design and implement sequential logic circuits using SystemVerilog.

## Contents
This lab contains the following files:

- `constraints.xdc`: The constraint file in SystemVerilog.
- `lab2(1).drawio`: Diagram representing the circuit.
- `lab_3.sv`: SystemVerilog code for the sequential circuit.
- `full_adder_tb.sv` SystemVerilog code for the test bench.
## Instructions

1. **Understanding the Design**
   - Review the given sequential logic design problem statement.
   - Analyze the state diagrams and transition tables.

2. **Coding in SystemVerilog**
   - Write SystemVerilog code (`lab_3.sv`) to describe the circuit.
   - Create a constraints file to assign each variable/IO in `constraints.xdc`.

3. **Simulating the Circuit**
   - Use Xilinx Vivado to compile and simulate the SystemVerilog code.
   - Run testbench simulations to validate functionality.

4. **Verifying Results**
   - Compare the simulated results with expected outputs.
   - Create a state transition table.
   - Implement/program the FPGA in the lab.
   - Debug and refine the code and logic if necessary.

## Expected Results

- The designed circuit should correctly implement the given sequential logic function.
