# ðŸŽ‡Lab 2: Digital System Design - Combinational Logic

## â™ŸObjective
The purpose of this lab is to design and implement combinational logic circuits using Verilog. Students will learn how to describe logic circuits using HDL, simulate their behavior, and analyze the results.

## â™ŸContents
This lab contains the following files:
- `lab2_design.v` - Verilog code for the combinational circuit.
- `lab2_testbench.v` - Testbench for simulating the design.
- `lab2_waveform.gtkw` - GTKWave configuration file for viewing simulation results.
- `lab2_report.pdf` - Lab report with design details and observations.

## â™ŸInstructions
1. **Understanding the Design**  
   - Review the given logic design problem statement.  
   - Analyze the truth table and logic equations.  

2. **Coding in Verilog**  
   - Write Verilog code (`lab2_design.v`) to describe the circuit.  
   - Create a testbench (`lab2_testbench.v`) to verify the design.  

3. **Simulating the Circuit**  
   - Use ModelSim/Xilinx Vivado to compile and simulate the Verilog code.  
   - Run testbench simulations to validate functionality.  
   - Open `lab2_waveform.gtkw` in GTKWave to analyze the output signals.  

4. **Verifying Results**  
   - Compare the simulated results with expected outputs.  
   - Debug and refine the code if necessary.  

5. **Documenting Observations**  
   - Record the simulation waveforms and results in `lab2_report.pdf`.  
   - Explain any discrepancies and provide conclusions.  

## â™ŸExpected Results
- The designed circuit should correctly implement the given combinational logic function.  
- The testbench should confirm expected outputs for all input conditions.  

## â™ŸNotes
- Ensure all variables and signal names are meaningful.  
- Follow proper indentation and commenting in Verilog code.  
- Use a step-by-step approach for debugging if the simulation results donâ€™t match expectations.
