# ðŸŽ‡Lab 2: Digital System Design - Combinational Logic

## â™ŸObjective
The purpose of this lab is to design and implement combinational logic circuits using System Verilog.

## â™ŸContents
This lab contains the following files:
- `constraints.xdc` - The constraint file itself in system System Verilog.
- `lab2.drawio` - Drawio diagram/ representation of the circuit. 
- `lab2.sv` - System Verilog code for the combinational circuit.

## â™ŸInstructions
1. **Understanding the Design**  
   - Review the given logic design problem statement.  
   - Analyze the truth table and logic equations.  

2. **Coding in System Verilog**  
   - Write System Verilog code (`lab2.sv`) to describe the circuit.  
   - Creating a Constraints file to assign each variable/IOs in (`constraints.sv`).

3. **Simulating the Circuit**  
   - Use Xilinx Vivado to compile and simulate the System Verilog code.  
   - Run testbench simulations to validate functionality.   

4. **Verifying Results**  
   - Compare the simulated results with expected outputs.
   - Creating a Truth table.
   - Followed by implementation/programming the FPGA in Lab.  
   - Debug and refine the code and logic if necessary.   

## â™ŸExpected Results
- The designed circuit should correctly implement the given combinational logic function.  
- The testbench and FPGA outputs should confirm expected outputs for all input conditions.  

## â™ŸNotes
- Ensure all variables names are meaningful.  
- Follow proper indentation and commenting in Verilog code.  
- Use a step-by-step approach for debugging if the simulation results donâ€™t match expectations.
